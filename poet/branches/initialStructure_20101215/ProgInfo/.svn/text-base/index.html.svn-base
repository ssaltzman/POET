            Thank you for participating in this survey.It is intended to assess the political, operational, economic, and technical (POET) factors associated with your project.
            By assessing the POET factors and their interactions, we hope to provide feedback and a greater level of understanding to all of the project stakeholders
            (i.e., program management, contractors, leadership, end users, etc).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This survey should take approximately <span id="surveyTime">15</span> minutes. You will be asked on each item to specify your level of agreement with a statement.
            Additionally, some questions will give you the option of adding comments or feedback. Your anonymity will be maintained and your answers will
            not be reported with your name. Instead, results will be reported with the project group of which you are a part (e.g., contractor) to gain
            understanding on how different groups of project stakeholders view the POET factors. The final results will be made available to you after
            everyone has had an opportunity to respond.    
        </p>
